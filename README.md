# AppliedProgramming_Module3-4-5


This is a multi-faceted project combining modules 3, 4, and 5 (Networking, Mobile App, Game Platform). This is a small game app that can be run on mobile via the apk file or on windows via the exe file. This was created with the Godot game engine.

# Overview

This small application features simple game mechanics, mobile app interface and input, and networking. I created this to improve my skills in creating a small game/app and exporting it for android. I believe this project has helped me increase my knowledge with this game engine and has also provided an opportunity for me to learn how I might be able to develop games for the google play store.

The app consists of making an object move, getting a score, and connecting to a network wirelessly.
